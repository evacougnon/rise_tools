RISE_tools

python and matlab scripts to read circum antarctic model output under 
the Realist Ice sheet/ocean State Estimates (RISE)

Mostly with the purpose of backing up the scripts

Many scripts would be based on other scientits work, including:
Kaitlin Naughten
Ole Richter

The link to their GitHub repository should appear at the start of each script inspired by their work
